          <SectionHeading>Q: What does Rhythmisch mean?</SectionHeading>
          <SectionParagraph>

            Q: Can I use Rhythmisch on another device?
          </SectionHeading>
          <SectionParagraph>
            A: Rhythmisch data is stored locally on your device using a browser
            technology called{' '}
            <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">
              local storage
            </Link>
            . Each browser, on <em>each device</em>, has its own local storage.
            You can use Rhythmisch on different browsers and different devices
            but the data won't be synced or shared.

          </SectionHeading>
          <SectionParagraph>
            A: This is sort of the first habit, isn't it? While Rhythmisch does
            not have any settings for notifications what does work well is
            adding a reminder on your phone. For example, reminders can be
            created on{' '}

        <section>
          <SectionHeading>Q: Is my data safe?</SectionHeading>
          <SectionParagraph>
            A: Data is stored in the browser on your device via{' '}
            <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">
              local storage
            </Link>{' '}
            and never sent over the web. If someone were able to access your
            device they would be able to access Rhythmisch.

        <section>
          <SectionHeading>Q: Why is the app so limited?</SectionHeading>
          <SectionParagraph>
            A: The hope is that with these limitations that there is less
            distractions and that you're able to easily kickstart the habit into
            action. Once you're rolling there are plenty of other apps, tools,
            techniques to upgrade to that provide more advanced features. That
            said, feel free to reach out on{' '}
